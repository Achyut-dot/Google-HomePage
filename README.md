Google HomePage Replica 

This project is a simplified replica of Google's homepage, featuring a navigation bar with links to Gmail and Images, a search section with input fields for text and voice search, language options, and a footer with additional links. The layout is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes. The HTML structure follows semantic conventions for improved accessibility and SEO. CSS styles are used to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the elements, with attention to detail for consistency and user experience. The JavaScript functionality includes intercepting form submission to redirect searches to Google's search results page. Overall, it's a basic web project demonstrating HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, inspired by Google's iconic homepage design.
